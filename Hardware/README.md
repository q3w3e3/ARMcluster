# Hardware and Build

## Rev1

For my first revision of the layout for the cluster I sought to pack everything in the smallest volume possible, with little regard for airflow or how the whole thing would be encased.

I didnt do much work at this scale as it didnt get much airflow to a few of the boards.

## Rev2

I then added shrouding and a case, as shown here:

This second revision both added shrouds to encourage airflow acros all the boards, as well as a case, and a slightly improved layout encouraging airflow across the switch, and power supply.

I had some fun with the case design... by which I mean I beveled the corners, and added some hexagonal vent holes. This case will likely be 3d printed in 2 or 4 parts, and bonded together, but I may opt to get it laser cut in acryllic once I finalize the design.

As it sits right now, there are cavities for captive m3 nuts to allow for the mounting of the switch, psu, and the stack of SBC.
