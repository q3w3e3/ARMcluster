# ARMcluster

This repo will contain as much of my work on the arm cluster as I bother to doccument.

## Hardware

After seeing Nick Smith's [96 core SBC cluster](https://climbers.net/sbc/nanopi-fire3-arm-supercomputer/) on hackaday of all places I had the idea of a large SBC cluster. About a year later I ran across Oracle's [1024 node cluster](https://blogs.oracle.com/developers/building-the-world%e2%80%99s-largest-raspberry-pi-cluster). It was around this time that my research work on computational nuclear physics was getting going, and a cluster of sbc as a testbed for HPC workloads and their optimizations was looking more and more like an interesting and viable project.

The addition of fans will bring me over my planned soft budget of $700, but I will address cooling later.
